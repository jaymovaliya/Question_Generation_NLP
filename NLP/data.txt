Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" progressively improve performance on a specific task with data, without being explicitly programmed.
The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel. Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs.
Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision.
Machine learning is sometimes conflated with ​ data mining​ , where the latter subfield focuses more on ​ exploratory data analysis​ and is known as ​ unsupervised learning​ .
An ​ artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called "neural network" (NN), is a learning algorithm that is vaguely inspired by ​ biological neural networks​ .
